# R&C Company Website - Web Pages


I used reference from other sites scroll effects and tried to add some special touch and used all these stuff to look cool. was not sure what name to put for a company so i used r & c randomly beacause it came up during web search you could generate content according to the layout and use it fro yourself
This is a bunch of files for the R&C Company website. It looks pretty cool with its special sliding pages and glass-like stuff. These files are like the "front part" of the website, and they're ready to work with a "back part" made with PHP.

## Cool Stuff It Does

*   **Pages Slide Nicely (on big screens):** When you scroll on a computer, the pages slide smoothly from one to the next. It's pretty neat!
*   **Works Like Normal (on phones):** On phones and tablets, it just scrolls like any other website, which is easier to use.
*   **Looks Good Everywhere:** No matter if you're on a giant screen or a tiny phone, the website adjusts itself to look good.
*   **See-Through Glass Look:** Some parts of the website have a cool, blurry, see-through glass effect.
*   **Same Style All Over:** The colors (orange, blue, dark) and overall look are the same on every page.
*   **Buttons and Stuff:** There are little dots on the side to jump between pages, a WhatsApp button that shows a QR code, and a form you can fill out.

## The Pages You Get

*   **`index.php`**: This would be the main page you land on.
*   **`about.php`**: This would be the about page you land on.
*   **`projects.php`**: Shows off different projects, each on its own full screen, with a footer that sits on top at the very end.
*   **`services.php`**: Explains what the company does, its services, and the tools it uses. Everything is neatly organized into sections.
*   **`contact.php`**: Has info on how to reach the company, like a map, office details, and a simple form to send a message.

## What's Used to Make It

*   **php:** This is like the skeleton of the pages, holding all the words and pictures.
*   **CSS:** This is the clothes and makeup for the skeleton, making it look pretty.
*   **JavaScript:** This makes things move and react when you click or scroll.
*   **Bootstrap:** A helper tool that makes it easier to make the website look good on different screen sizes.
*   **Font Awesome:** This gives us all the cool little icons (like phone, email, social media).
